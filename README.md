## Python API Challenge

In this challenge we were tasked to pull weather data from the Open Weather API for 500-1000 randomly selected cities around the world. We then created a program that narrowed that list down by various weather features, such as average temperature, cloudiness, humidity, etc. This was done to create a list of ideal vacation spots around the world.
